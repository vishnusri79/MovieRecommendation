# MovieRecommendation
The Movie Recommendation System is a web-based application developed using React, integrating with TMDB (The Movie Database) API to provide users with popular movies, search capabilities, and a personalized movie rating system. The application includes user authentication (via Firebase) and allows users to log in, rate movies, and see tailored recommendations.

Core Features
Header with Navigation and Authentication:

Logo and Navigation Bar: Includes a logo and a navigation bar with options such as "Home," "Movies," "TV," "Entertainment," and "Sports."
Search Bar: Users can search for movies or genres directly from the search bar, which fetches results from the TMDB API.
Authentication: Users have the option to either log in or sign up using email authentication provided by Firebase. Once authenticated, users can access additional features like rating movies.
Popular Movies Display:

Movie Cards: The homepage displays a grid of movie cards showcasing popular movies fetched from the TMDB API. Each card includes the movie title, rating, and an image.
Modern Animations: The cards include subtle animations, making the user interface visually appealing and interactive.
Movie Search Functionality:

Search by Title or Genre: The search bar allows users to find specific movies by entering their title or genre. The results update dynamically, showing movie options with modern animations for a professional touch.
Movie Details Page:

Click to View Details: Users can click on any movie to view more detailed information, such as the movieâ€™s synopsis, director, cast, release year, and genre. This information is fetched from the TMDB API.
Rate a Movie:

Rating Feature: Authenticated users can rate movies. Once logged in, they see a "Rate a Movie" option in the navigation bar. After clicking, users are presented with a form where they enter the movie name, director, year released, genre, and rating.

Footer:

Professional Design: A clean, professional footer provides links to relevant sections of the application and includes basic information about the app.
User Authentication (Sign Up, Login, Logout):

Firebase Integration: The app uses Firebase authentication for email-based sign-ups and logins. After successful login, users see a personalized navigation option to "Rate a Movie" and a "Sign Out" button.
Sign Out: Users can log out using the "Sign Out" button, which redirects them to the homepage.
